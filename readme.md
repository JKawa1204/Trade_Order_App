# Trade Order Processor

This project is a Python-based **Trade Order Processor** application designed to handle trade orders efficiently using data structures like **queues**, **stacks**, **binary search trees**, and **transaction histories**. The system provides functionality for adding, processing, undoing, viewing, and searching orders with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Tkinter**.

## Features

- **Queue-based Order Management**: Add orders to a queue and process them sequentially.
- **Undo Last Action**: Revert the last processed order using a stack.
- **Efficient Searching**: Use a binary search tree to manage and search for processed orders by asset symbol.
- **Transaction History**: Keep track of all processed orders and display them in a sorted order.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter, the GUI offers an intuitive interface to interact with the system.
